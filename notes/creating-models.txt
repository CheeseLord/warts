For actually creating models, you need some sort of modeling software. Examples
include 3d Studio Max, Blender, and Maya. I will try using Blender.

Per
    https://www.panda3d.org/manual/index.php/Model_Export
you need to use Panda3D's special format for files.
    https://www.panda3d.org/manual/index.php/Converting_from_Blender
describes your options for exporting to that format from Blender.

Steps so far:
    Install Blender
    Download YABEE as a .zip file from:
        https://github.com/09th/YABEE
    Run Blender
        File > User Preferences (Ctrl+Alt+U)
        Addons
        Install from File
        Double-click the YABEE zip
        There should now be an "Import-Export: Panda3d EGG format" addon listed
            in the Addons tab. On the right side it will have 3 little icons,
            one of which is a checkbox. Check the box to actually activate it.
        Finally, click "Save User Settings" so you don't have to re-check the
            box every time you restart Blender.
    You should now be able to export models from Blender using
        File > Export > Panda3D (.egg)

Note: YABEE seems to only export the things you have selected, so you might
want to hit "a" (select all) before you export.

You can preview a Panda egg using the 'pview' command (from a terminal).

In principle, once you've created a model, you can add the model to the world
by just calling
    model = loader.loadModel("path goes here")
    model.reparentTo(render)
See
    https://www.panda3d.org/manual/index.php/Loading_Models

The filepaths are kinda weird. That page also describes what you need to do if
you want to load based on a filepath relative to the actual program's location.

As far as positioning, rotating, and scaling the model so it's visible and
sanely-sized, you're pretty much on your own. But see:
    https://www.panda3d.org/manual/index.php/Common_State_Changes
for a quick overview of the functions to set those parameters.
