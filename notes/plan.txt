Some sort of collaborative RTS?


Like pandemic.
Maybe a "multiplayer sim city"?

Like the idea of resource collection
    - Finite/infinite total resources?
    - Few/many varieties of resources?

Also, what do with resources?

Should be possible to trade, but with a cost (not just a single pool that
everyone draws from).

"Don't like realism as a general rule".
High fantasy or absurdist fantasy setting?
Troll more.
    - Subvert *all* the tropes.

Finite map
Start with hand-drawn maps
    - Maybe have an option to use procedurally-generated maps?

Themes?
    - Settling a high-fantasy world
        - Fight against disease?
        - Natives
        - Weather / the elements
            - Lightning, meteors, fire, alien invasion, pixie storms, acid fog
        - Research

Win condition?
    - Don't want it to have to do with the natives
    - Could just be a time limit
        - Can keep score; goal could be to maximize score
        - Seems unsatisfying for an RTS
    - Should have points, but want them to be more or less incidental, not the
      main mechanic
    - Trying to reach some destination?
        - Need to make sure it's collaborative
        - Could start at the same place but want to get to two different
          locations?

Probably not have perfect symmetry between the players
    - Different goals?
    - Different abilities?
    - Different win conditions??
        - Probably not; not so collaborative

Want to break apart the party somehow, make trading more interesting
    - Have two different destinations, need different players to reach each
      one?
        - Seems a bit arbitrary/contrived; rather find a different way
    - Various relics you need to retrieve?
        - Make the difficulty ramp up (natives tech up? elements get worse?)
          and have enough relics that realistically you can't just stay
          together and get one at a time.

Have each player control one race?
    - Would give each one their own specialties and weaknesses

Maybe the natives are humans?
    - Not a post-apocalyptic Earth, though -- too serious
    - Just make them humans, don't explain it
    - Makes sense that they're building up technology to destroy you
    - Also they should occasionally (or often?) fight each other

Do we want games to be long-running (like civ) or short (like SC)? How long
does it take to explore the tech tree?
    - Probably make it so there isn't enough time to explore the whole tech
      tree, need to pick a direction to go in
    - Which means we probably want to tend toward shorter games

What makes one game different from another?
    - Randomize (within limits) starting locations?
    - Randomize (within limits) distribution of resources?
    - Bunch of tribes of humans, each independently exploring the human tech
      tree
        - As they fight each other and one comes out on top, they could use
          the other conquered tribes as cheap slave labor / conscripted
          soldiers, send them at you like the zerg
        - Also, humans can use diplomacy on each other

Need appropriately silly resources?
    - Everything's made of ochre jelly?
    - Go the DF route and only drink booze?
        - Maybe only the dwarves?

Maybe want a lot of resources?
    - Don't want them all generally used
    - A bunch of specific resources used for a bunch of specific purposes?
    - Would mean that you're basically guaranteed to have a bunch of things you
      just can't build for lack of resources
        - Could be interesting, will probably be annoying
    - Probably want almost everything to be built with just a few resources
    - What about if the special resources control "addon upgrades"?
        - Find pool of acid, create acid-tipped weapons or whatever
        - Can still make all the types of units/buildings/whatever without them
        - Basically they just unlock stuff that's nice to have, but you can
          live without.

Want to distinguish the gameplay from SC/WC. Also more focus on macro
(strategy) than micro ("clicking fast").
    - Maybe not have individual control over all units?
        - Give them tasks, they do them
        - Just say "hey you, elves, you're going on this quest"
        - Need to make sure the units are fungible
        - Control of army units could be annoying, but maybe have an army
          allocation interface where you choose what sort of units you want?
          "Get me a few ranged units, a bunch of melee units, and something
          good against fortifications"
